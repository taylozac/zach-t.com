Zach is also the vice president of the [Oregon State Security Club](https://osusec.org) (OSUSEC).

In his free time, Zach likes to get outside and hike, climb, and travel around the counry (and hopefully the world). He also enjoys cooking and using it to explore cultures of places he has yet to visit. While cooking, you can usually find him enjoying a craft beer from around Oregon.
